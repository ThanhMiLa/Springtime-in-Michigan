        <h1>Springtime in Michigan</h1>
        
        <p>Springtime in <a href="#">Ann Arbor</a> is a beautiful time. Even though it can be chilly at times, it is nice to walk my dog Bacon. This site includes some pictures I have taken on these walks.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes we walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it to the woods. Ann Arbor also has some beautiful lakes and rivers including the <a href="#">Huron River Watertrail</a> and the <a href="#">Argo Park Cascades</a>.</p>
